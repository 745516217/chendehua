An American astronomer of Dutch origin, he specialised in the field of planetary physics. He was born and brought up in Holland but in 1933 he travelled to the USA and in 1937 obtained American citizenship. Since 1943 he was a professor <br/>at a university in Chicago. <br/>In 1944 he discovered <br/>the presence of methane <br/>in the atmosphere of one <br/>of Saturn's moons – Titan. <br/>In 1948, he discovered <br/>the fifth satellite of Uranus <br/>– Miranda, and a year <br/>later the second satellite <br/>of Neptune – Nereid. In 1951 he put forward the hypothesis that somewhere beyond <br/>the orbit of Neptune there existed a belt of tiny objects, made up of rocks and ice planetoids; the waste that remained after the formation of the Solar System. The first of the planetoids in this belt was discovered in 1992 <br/>and was called 1992 QB1.
