<br/>A German physicist. He discovered (on 8 November 1895), a type of radiation, which he named 'X-rays'. His discovery earned him the very first Nobel Prize in Physics, awarded in 1901. The name 'X-rays' has been used right up to modern times, although in some countries the radiation is referred to as 'Roentgen rays'.
