Danish astronomer. He was famous for his discovery, made in 1676, that the speed of light is finite; he estimated it to be 220 000 kilometres per second. The discovery resulted from his observation of the eclipses of the three inner moons of Jupiter. In 1681 he was appointed a professor of astronomy at the University of Copenhagen. He conducted his astronomic observations in Rundetårn (Eng. Round Tower), which used to be a part of the university. At the age of 61 he was made the chief of the Copenhagen police, a position he held until his death on 19 September 1710.
