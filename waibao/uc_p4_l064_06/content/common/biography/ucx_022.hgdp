English physicist <br/>and chemist. He was the first to produce an electric current from a magnetic field, invented the first electric motor and dynamo, demonstrated the relation between electricity <br/>and chemical bonding, discovered the effect <br/>of magnetism on light, <br/>and discovered and named diamagnetism, the peculiar behaviour of certain substances in strong magnetic fields. <br/>In 1813 he became <br/>Sir Humphry Davy’s assistant at the Royal Institution <br/>in London. Faraday <br/>was made a member <br/>of the institution in 1823 <br/>and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1824. In 1825 <br/>he became director <br/>of the laboratory, and from 1833 he was Fullerian professor of chemistry <br/>at the Royal Institution. Some of his works were collected as <i>Experimental Researches in Electricity</i> (3 vol., 1839–1855) and <i>Experimental Researches in Chemistry <br/>and Physics</i> (1859).
