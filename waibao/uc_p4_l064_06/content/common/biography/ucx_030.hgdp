A Scottish physicist. In 1927 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for the invention of a method which uses vapour condensation to make the paths of electrically charged particles visible. Wilson wanted to become a doctor – he studied biology at the university in Manchester and then commenced studies in Cambridge, where he became interested in  physics and chemistry. In later years he was attracted by meteorology and in 1893 he commenced studies on clouds and their properties. He worked for some time at the observatory on Ben Nevis, where he made observations of cloud formations. On his return to Cambridge he tried to reproduce the effect on a smaller scale in closed chambers. In his experiments he also applied ions and radiation, which led to the development of a condensation chamber thus making it possible to observe the paths of particles – this invention gained him a Nobel Prize in physics.
