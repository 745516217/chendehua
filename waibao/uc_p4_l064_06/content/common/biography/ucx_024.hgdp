A British physicist, chemist and meteorologist. A weaver's son, he obtained <br/>an education despite <br/>the poor material condition <br/>of his family. He studied <br/>by himself, natural sciences and languages. Before <br/>he could commit himself totally to research, he worked as a teacher in Cumberland (England). His greatest achievement was the atomic theory of matter, published <br/>in 1803. He also investigated the properties of gases. <br/>In 1803 he formulated <br/>the law of partial pressures, in 1804 the law of multiple proportions, one <br/>of the fundamental laws <br/>in chemistry. He also described daltonism – colour blindness, a condition <br/>with which he himself <br/>was affected. It involves <br/>the inability to distinguish colours – especially red <br/>and green. Daltonism <br/>is an inborn, hereditary <br/>and incurable condition. <br/>It was named after <br/>its discoverer. Dalton <br/>also conducted meteorological research: <br/>he studied the composition <br/>of the atmosphere, constructed barometers <br/>and engaged in weather forecasting.
