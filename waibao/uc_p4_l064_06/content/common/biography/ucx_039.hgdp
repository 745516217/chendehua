A German astronomer and mathematician; during his studies he became familiar with the works of Copernicus and became the supporter <br/>of his heliocentric theory <br/>(of the solar system). <br/>Using the results <br/>of the observations conducted by Brahe, he analysed <br/>the movements of the planets and suggested that <br/>the planets move around <br/>the Sun in elliptical shaped orbits, and that the Sun <br/>is the source of the force that keeps the planets <br/>in their orbits. <br/>He encapsulated the results of his thinking in the three laws of planetary motion (now known as Kepler's Laws). These laws were vital to the work of later generations of astronomers. Kepler also invented <br/>a telescope made from <br/>two converging lenses.</body></html>
