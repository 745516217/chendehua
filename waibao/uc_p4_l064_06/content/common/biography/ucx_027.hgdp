A Danish physicist. In 1911, he was granted a PhD degree at the university of Copenhagen; in 1913 he presented a model of an atom of hydrogen, with a structure which complied with his postulates. In 1922 Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for the formulation of a theory to explain the structure of an atom. He also contributed to the development of quantum mechanics. During the war he was a member of the Manhattan project (an American program for the construction of a weapon of mass destruction – an atomic bomb). However, for reasons of conscience, he did not contribute much to the work. After the war he returned to Copenhagen and advocated the peaceful application of atomic energy. In honour of Niels Bohr, an element with the atomic number 107 was named after him.
