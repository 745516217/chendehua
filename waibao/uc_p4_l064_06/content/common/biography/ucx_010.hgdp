Danish physicist <br/>and philosopher. He studied medicine <br/>at the University <br/>of Copenhagen, where <br/>he obtained his doctoral degree. In 1820 <br/>he discovered the relationship between a current-carrying conductor and a magnetic field. He made his discovery by accident during one of his presentations for advanced students. The discovery <br/>of Oersted was used <br/>in the invention <br/>of an electromagnet, which, combined with Volt's battery, made it possible to construct an electric telegraph. Then <br/>a whole series of discoveries by various scientists resulted in the construction <br/>of a loudspeaker, then <br/> radio, and so on. <br/>The most important follow-up was a generator of electric current – the work <br/>of Faraday. Owing to this invention, the transport <br/>and electrical industry <br/>was able to develop. <br/>Oersted received numerous awards for his discovery <br/>and as a result he became financially independent. <br/>He was one of the few scientists who could see <br/>the application of their discoveries in everyday life.</body></html>
