French physicist. The first <br/>to measure (1849) <br/>the velocity of light in air, <br/>he also determined its <br/>speed in water. He made valuable discoveries <br/>on the polarization of light and the expansion of crystals, explained the Doppler effect, and devised a method <br/>of increasing the permanency of daguerreotypes. With Léon Foucault he took the first clear photograph <br/>of the surface of the sun.
