An American inventor <br/>and artist. In 1823, <br/>he patented a machine <br/>for cutting marble, <br/>and in the years 1835–1838 he constructed the first electromagnetic telegraph. Two years later, he devised <br/>a special alphabet <br/>for the device, which became known as Morse code. <br/>The code consisted of dots and dashes and was <br/>used almost until the end <br/>of the 20th century. The first message in which the code was applied was transmitted on 24 May 1844. Morse also introduced daguerreotype photography (invented in Europe) in the USA.
