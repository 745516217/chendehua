An American radio engineer. <br/>He was a constructor <br/>of radio receivers. He conducted research on how to avoid disturbances that occur during the transmission of radio programmes encoded using the AM system. However, instead <br/>of improving the AM system, which was common at that time, he proved that a much better sound quality <br/>could be obtained with <br/>the so-called FM encoding. <br/>In 1918 he constructed <br/>a superheterodyne receiver and in 1933 he obtained <br/>a patent for the transmission of sound by means of radio waves encoded in the FM system.
