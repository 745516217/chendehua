Polish-French physicist and chemist. Upon completing her education in gymnasium <br/>in 1883, she was awarded <br/>a gold medal. She then worked for seven years <br/>as a private tutor, <br/>and in 1891 she left <br/>for Paris to commence her university studies. There <br/>she received a Bachelor <br/>of Science degree in physics and in mathematics. In 1895 she married Pierre Curie. Together, they conducted research in the field <br/>of radioactivity and discovered the elements they called polonium and radium. <br/>The discovery earned Marie, Pierre Currie and Henri Becquerel a Noble Prize <br/>in physics. In 1911, Marie Curie was awarded her second Noble Prize, this time in chemistry, for the isolation of radium in pure state <br/>and radium in metallic state. She died on 4 July 1934 <br/>as a result of a disease that had most probably been caused by her many years <br/>of dealing with radioactive compounds.</body></html>
