A Russian physicist <br/>of German origin. From <br/>1830 he was a member <br/>of the Academy of Science <br/>in Petersburg. In 1836 <br/>he was appointed <br/>a professor at the university of Petersburg. Lenz conducted work on electricity and geophysics. In 1833 <br/>he formulated a law, later called Lenz’s Law, which determined the direction <br/>of the flow of electric current due <br/>to electromagnetic induction through a circuit – the rule states that: the direction <br/>of the induced current <br/>is always such that <br/>the magnetic field generated by the current opposes <br/>the cause of the current. <br/>In 1842, independently <br/>of J.P. Joule, Lenz devised his own law for determining the amount of heat emitted across a conductor during the flow of an electric current (Joule-Lenz Law).</body></html>
