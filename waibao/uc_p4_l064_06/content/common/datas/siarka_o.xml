Another method, known as the Frasch process, involves underground melting of sulphur by superheated steam and pumping it with compressed air to the surface. Another source of sulphur is hydrogen sulphide (</text>

The products of the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen sulphide are sulphur and water. Sulphur can also be obtained by the reduction of sulphur dioxide in the presence of carbon (coke) or carbon monoxide (CO) as reducing agents. </text>
