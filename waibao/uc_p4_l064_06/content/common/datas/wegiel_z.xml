Graphite is a material for electrodes, crucibles for heating substances and for the production of lubricants and pigments. In nuclear power plants it is used as a moderator in reactor cores. Diamond is used in the manufacture of drills, glass-cutting knives and abrasives, and in jewellery as a valuable gemstone. The highly adsorptive form of carbon known as activated carbon is used in filters. The carbon isotope C-14 is used for establishing the age of fossils and rocks. The internationally recognised atomic mass unit is equal to one twelfth of the mass of a C-12 atom.</text>
