It reacts gradually with hydrofluoric acid - HF. Niobium burns when heated. At high temperatures it reacts with hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon and the halogens. Niobium was discovered by an English chemist, Charles Hatchett, in 1801. It is named after Niobe, the mythical daughter of Tantalus, since it is usually found associated with tantalum.</text>
