Due to its high reactivity, calcium has to be stored in kerosene. On contact with air calcium oxidises to calcium oxide -CaO, even at room temperature. The metal reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide and hydrogen; with acids - to produce salts and hydrogen. At elevated temperatures calcium also reacts with nitrogen and the halogens.</text>
