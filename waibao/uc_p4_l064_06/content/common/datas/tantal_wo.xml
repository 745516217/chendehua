Tantalum is characterised by very high chemical resistance to most reagents; at room temperature it remains unaffected by alkalis and acids, with the exception of hydrofluoric acid. Tantalum burns when heated to form tantalum(V) oxide</text>

      <text fn="Arial" fh="15" fc="16777215" fa="1" charset="238">. Tantalum was discovered by the Swedish chemist Anders Gustaf Ekebeg in 1802. It was first isolated by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1820. The element was named after the mythological character Tantalus, the father of Niobe.</text>
