Resistant to acids and alkalis, it dissolves only in nitric acid(V) and aqua regia (a mixture of 3 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1 part of concentrated nitric(V) acid by weight. At elevated temperatures palladium reacts with oxygen, sulphur and the halogens. Palladium has the ability to absorb hydrogen (up to 900 times its own volume); it expands and becomes brittle as a result. It was discovered in 1803 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston, and was named after the asteroid Pallas, discovered in the same year.</text>
