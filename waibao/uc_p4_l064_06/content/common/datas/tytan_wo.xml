      <text fn="Arial" fh="15" fc="16777215" fa="1" charset="238">. At elevated temperatures titianium reacts with many elements. In reactions with chlorine, nitrogen and carbon it produces, respectively, chlorides, nitrides and carbides. The  element was named after the mythological gods, the Titans. Titanium was discovered in 1791 by an English priest, chemist and mineralogist William Gregor, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in 1795. The metal was first isolated and purified by Matthew A. Hunter in 1910.</text>
