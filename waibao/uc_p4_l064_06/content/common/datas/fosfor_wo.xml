White phosphorus is poisonous and highly flammable; glows in the dark. The black form of phosphorus has a metallic lustre; it is a weak conductor of electricity and heat. Phosphorus was discovered by a German alchemist, Hennig Brand, in Hamburg in 1669. The symbol P was assigned to phosphorus by Jöns Jacob Berzelius.</text>
