It is a good conductor of electricity, but a poor conductor of heat. Mercury alloys with many metals to form amalgams. Vapour and compounds of mercury are highly poisonous. If there is a spill, special precautions must be taken: the mercury must be quickly collected in a container and the remains must be covered with powdered sulphur (which reacts with mercury to produce mercury(II) sulphide HgS) or with zinc dust (zinc amalgam is thus formed). Mercury was known as early as in ancient times.</text>
