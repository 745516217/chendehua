It  was discovered in 1766 by the renowned British chemist Henry Cavendish, who referred to it as ”flammable air”. In 1883 hydrogen was liquefied by Karol Olszewski and Zygmunt Wroblewski. Three isotopes of hydrogen are known: protium, deuterium and tritium, each having its own individual name and chemical symbol. Common hydrogen, with a mass number of 1, is known as protium; heavy hydrogen, the isotope with the mass number of 2, is deuterium. Tritium (T), the heaviest isotope of hydrogen, is radioactive and unstable and has a mass number of 3.</text>
