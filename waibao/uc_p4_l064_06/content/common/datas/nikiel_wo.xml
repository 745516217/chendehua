It exhibits ferromagnetic properties - it becomes highly magnetised in a magnetic field. For nickel the Curie point (the temperature at which an element loses its ferromagnetic properties) is found to be 357</text>

When heated, it reacts with phosphorus, arsenic, oxygen and the halogens. Nickel dissolves in acids, displacing hydrogen. The element and its compounds are toxic. Nickel was first isolated by a Swedish chemist and mineralogist, Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, in 1751. Its name is derived from the German expression </text>
