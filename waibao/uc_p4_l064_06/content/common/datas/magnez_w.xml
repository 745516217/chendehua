In terms of abundance in the Earth's crust, magnesium ranks 7th, making up 2.3% of the Earth's crust by weight. Considerable amounts of magnesium are present in seawater. Magnesium is also an essential component of chlorophyll - the green pigment found in the leaves and stems of green plants. It is also present in animal tissue.</text>
