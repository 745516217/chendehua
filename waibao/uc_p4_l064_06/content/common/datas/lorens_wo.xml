It was first produced in 1961 by Albert Ghiorso, T. Sikkeland, A. Larsh and R.Latimer by the bombardment of a mixture of californium isotopes with boron-10 and boron-11 ions. The most stable lawrencium isotope is </text>

The element was named after the American physicist Ernest O. Lawrence - the inventor of the cyclotron and founder of the laboratory of the University of California in Berkeley, USA.</text>
